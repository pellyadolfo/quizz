	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Virtualization - VM": "A virtual machine, also known as a VM, emulates a real computer that can execute programs and applications without having direct contact with any actual hardware. Microsoft Azure defines a VM as a “computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, a computer is created within a computer.”",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Virtualization - VM - How": "VMs provide hardware virtualization. VMs work by operating on top of a hypervisor, which, in turn, is stacked up on top of either a host machine or a 'bare-metal' (the hardware) host. A hypervisor, also known as a machine monitor, can either be a piece of software, firmware, or hardware that enables you to create and run VMs. Each VM runs its own unique guest operating system, thus enabling you to have a group of VMs sitting alongside each other, each one with its own unique operating system. For example, you can have Linux VM sitting next to a UNIX VM. Each VM carries their own virtualized hardware stack that comprises of network adapters, storage, applications, binaries, libraries and its own CPU.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization": "The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Features": "Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are: Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized, Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel., Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly., Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere., Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas., Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly..",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Container": "Containers provide operating system-level virtualization. Each container comes packaged with its own user space to enable multiple containers to run on a single host. And since the OS is shared across all the containers, the components that need to be developed from scratch are the binaries and libraries — which can easily be added by a Docker image.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Container Runtme": "Container runtimes are responsible for creating, running, and managing containers. They provide a layer of abstraction between the host operating system and the container, allowing containers to be isolated from each other and from the host.",

	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Tools - OCI": "Open Container Initiative (OCI) container runtime specification. OCI, short for the Open Container Initiative, is indeed a community project that was established in 2015 to address the need for containerization standards. It is a collaborative effort within the container ecosystem to develop open industry standards for container formats and runtime.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Tools - OCI - keypoints - Standardization": "Standardization: OCI defines open standards for container images and runtimes.

This adoption has led to the development of a rich ecosystem of container tools, orchestrators, and platforms that are OCI-compliant.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Tools - OCI - OCI-runtime": "The OCI runtime spec defines how to interact with a container runtime to control the lifecycle of a container. While it might seem redundant (given that CRI seems to define the same thing), it adds another layer of contract definition to the architecture. As with CRI, this layer of contract gives some guarantees to the system regarding how the developer’s code will run.",

It is an application kernel that implements a Linux-like interface. Unlike Linux, it is written in a memory-safe language (Go) and runs in userspace. gVisor includes an Open Container Initiative (OCI) runtime called runsc that makes it easy to work with existing container tooling. The runsc runtime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed containers.",

  "2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization - Tools - Firecracker": "Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services.",
	"2. ChooseContainerRuntime - Containerization vs Virtualization": "Virtualization is an abstract version of a physical machine, while containerization is the abstract version of an application. While virtual machines virtualize a machine, a container virtualizes an entire operating system so that multiple workloads can run on a single OS instance. With VMs, the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple OS instances — which slows everything down and gradually increases the total cost of ownership. To avoid all of that, containers leverage one OS, increasing deployment speed and portability while lowering costs. A container is a Linux-based application that is used to isolate a service and its dependencies into a self-contained unit that you can run in any environment. The sole purpose of containers is to promote efficient use of the allocated server space and resources, thus enabling the isolated processes to run more efficiently and quickly, while giving developers the ability to scale up or down these individual containers very easily.",
