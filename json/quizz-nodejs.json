NodeJs is single threaded. In the ideal case that it’s designed for, requests should be I/O bound. A complex page requiring much SSR will hamstring the ability to serve concurrent requests.",

	"Async": "SECTION",
	"Async - AsyncLocalStorage": "Async context provides a way to handle asynchronous operations more gracefully, preserving the context across async calls, making debugging and tracing easier. A go-to feature for backend developers working with Node.js and complex async operations. AsyncLocalStorage  is a Node.js API (based on the async_hooks API) that is used to create asynchronous state within callbacks and promise chains.",

	"CICD": "SECTION",
  "CICD - compilation - SWC": "SWC (stands for Speedy Web Compiler ) is a super-fast TypeScript / JavaScript compiler written in Rust.",
  "CICD - compilation - SWC - WASM": "WebAssembly (WASM).",
  "CICD - compilation --experimental-strip-types": "A few days ago, the tech community woke up to the news that the experimental --experimental-strip-types flag has been added to Node.js, currently available in the Node 23 nightly build. This development allows developers to write TypeScript code using .ts files in Node.js without the need for a compile step. Previously, running TypeScript in Node.js required a build process to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript. This new feature eliminates that necessity, enabling direct execution of TypeScript files."
