The practice of combining projects dates back to the early 2000 when it was called a shared codebase.",
	"CICD - VCS - Monorepo - why": "There are two major advantages using a monorepo for a large scale codebase. First of all, shared packages can be used in multiple applications on a local machine without an online registry (e.g. npm). The developer experience improves tremendously here, because everything is in the same codebase without updating dependencies via third-parties. When a shared package gets updated, it gets immediately reflected in all applications which depend on it. Second, it improves collaboration across codebases. Teams working on different projects can improve the codebases from other teams without working on multiple repositories. It also improves accessibility without worrying about different setups and introduces a more flexible ownership of the source code across teams. Another benefit is the refactoring of code across many projects.",
