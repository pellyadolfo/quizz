	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive": "In JavaScript, primitive data types represent the simplest and most basic building blocks of data. They are fundamental values that are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once they are created. Primitive types are stored directly in memory and have a fixed size. These are stored directly in the stack, which is a simple memory allocation delivering quick access.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - Undefined": "Undefined: undefined is a special value that represents the absence of a value. It is often used as the default value of variables or function parameters that have not been assigned a value. Variables that are declared but not initialized are automatically assigned the value undefined.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - Null": "Null: null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used when you want to indicate that a variable should have no value or that an object property is intentionally empty. It is distinct from undefined.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - String": "String: Strings represent text and are enclosed in either single (‘’) or double quotes. They are used for storing and manipulating textual data. Strings are immutable, which means that any operation on a string creates a new string rather than modifying the original one.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - Number": "Number: Numbers represent numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers. They are used for performing mathematical operations. Numbers in JavaScript follow the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. Like strings, numbers are also immutable.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - Boolean": "Boolean: Booleans have only two possible values: true and false. They are used to represent logical values and are essential for making decisions in your code. Booleans are immutable and serve as the basis for conditional statements and boolean algebra.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Primitive - Symbol": "Symbol (ES6): Symbols are unique and immutable values introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). They are often used as property keys in objects to avoid naming conflicts.",
	"DataTypes - Inmutable - Record": "A Record is an immutable collection of key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects, but Records are immutable and have deep equality. Records are created using an object-like literal syntax prefixed with #. const record = #{ key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' };",

	"DataTypes - Reference - Map vs Object - Performance": "Better Performance for Frequent Additions/Removals: Maps are optimized for frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs. Objects, on the other hand, can suffer performance issues when properties are added or removed frequently, especially when dealing with a large number of entries.",
	"DataTypes - Reference - Map vs Object - Size": "Size Property: Maps have a size property that provides the number of elements in the map. This is more efficient than calculating the size of an object using Object.keys(obj).length, which has to traverse the entire key set.",
	"DataTypes - Reference - Map vs Object - Methods": "Built-In Methods: Maps come with built-in methods like set, get, has, delete, and clear which make manipulating key-value pairs straightforward and intuitive.",
	"DataTypes - Reference - Map vs Object - overhead": "Maps have a bit more overhead compared to plain objects due to their internal structure and additional features. For scenarios where performance is critical and the collection is small and simple, this overhead might be unnecessary.",

For shallow equality, you can use the === operator or its counterpart, the Object.is() method, which behaves similarly but handles edge cases differently (e.g., handling NaN and -0 differently).",
	"DataTypes - Operations - Equalying - Deep": "Deep equality requires custom comparison logic or libraries like Lodash’s isEqual method, which recursively checks the content of nested objects or arrays.",
	"DataTypes - Operations - Copying - Shallow": "To create an independent copy of an object (copy by value), you can use methods like Object.assign() or the spread operator (...). These methods create a shallow copy, which means they copy the top-level properties of the object but not nested objects. It’s essential to note that a shallow copy does not create copies of nested objects within the original object. Shallow Copy means the original data is unaffected by changes to the copied data for fundamental types. For reference types, a shallow copy might duplicate the first layer of an object, protecting the original data when modifying shallow properties in the copied object. https://javascript.plainenglish.io/is-the-spread-operator-a-deep-copy-261c109fb708",
	"DataTypes - Operations - Copying - Deep": "To create deep copies, which include all nested objects, you would need to implement a custom copying function or use a library like Lodash. Deep Copy represents limitless hierarchical duplication. Changes to either fundamental or reference data types in the deep copy do not affect the original.",
	"DataTypes - Operations - Passing by Value": "Passing Primitive Values: Passing by Value. When you pass a primitive value to a function, you are essentially passing a copy of that value. This is known as passing by value. Any changes made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.",
	"DataTypes - Operations - Passing by Reference": "Passing Reference Values: Passing by Reference. When you pass a reference type (such as an object or array) to a function, you are passing a reference to the actual data. This is known as passing by reference.

Hoisting a variable inside a function is a very useful and preferred way of dealing with a variable without even declaring it. It mainly helps to keep variables as local variables in a function and can be used only inside a function.

When a function is invoked, the body of the function will execute until it reaches the end. The function can’t be paused for other code to execute. Generator functions however are not “run to completion”. Generator functions can be paused and resumed so that other code can execute in between. The great thing about this behavior is that we can use generators to manage flow control. Because generators allow us to pause execution, we can easily cancel asynchronous operations. Generators also allow us to turn asynchronous code into synchronous-looking code. When you invoke a generator function, it won’t execute the body of the function like a regular function.
