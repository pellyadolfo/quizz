You can easily extend an interface using the extends keyword. This makes interfaces a natural choice when you're working with object-oriented design patterns. Types, on the other hand, are more flexible but less formal in their extensibility. You can’t directly extend a type in the same way, but you can achieve similar results using intersection types:",
