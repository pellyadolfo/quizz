	"AI - Types - ANI": "Artificial Narrow Intelligence. ANI is also referred to as Narrow AI or Weak AI. Also known as weak AI, ANI is not able to learn beyond its programmed capabilities. This type of artificial intelligence is one that focuses primarily on one single narrow task, with a limited range of abilities. If you think of an example of AI that exists in our lives right now, it is ANI. This is the only type out of the three that is currently around. This includes all kinds of Natural Language or Siri.",
	"AI - Types - AGI": "Artificial General Intelligence AGI technology would be on the level of a human mind. Due to this fact, it will probably be some time before we truly grasp AGI, as we still don’t know all there is to know about the human brain itself. However, in concept at least, AGI would be able to think on the same level as a human, much like Sonny the robot in I-Robot featuring Will Smith.",
	"AI - Types - ASI": "Artificial Super Intelligence This is where it gets a little theoretical and a touch scary. ASI refers to AI technology that will match and then surpass the human mind. To be classed as an ASI, the technology would have to be more capable than a human in every single way possible. Not only could these AI things carry out tasks, but they would even be capable of having emotions and relationships.",
