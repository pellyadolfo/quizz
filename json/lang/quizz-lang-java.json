While most developers won’t find a direct benefit from them, anyone who works with dynamic bytecode or JVM languages will likely find them useful. The goal of hidden classes is to allow the runtime creation of classes that are not discoverable. This means they cannot be linked by other classes, nor can they be discovered via reflection. Classes such as these typically have a short lifecycle, and thus, hidden classes are designed to be efficient with both loading and unloading.
