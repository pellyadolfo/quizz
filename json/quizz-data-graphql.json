	"GraphQL - History": "GraphQL, a query language and execution engine originally created at Facebook in 2012",
	"GraphQL - Features - Transport": "GraphQL and REST typically use HTTP as their transport layer, and they both leverage the standard HTTP POST method to send and receive data.",
	"GraphQL - Features - Formats": "GraphQL and REST use standard data formats for communication. JSON is the most commonly used format, but other formats, like XML or HTML, can also be used, especially in REST.",
	"GraphQL - Features - Stateless": "the server does not save response history between requests",

	"GraphQL - Schema": "SECTION",
	"GraphQL - Schema - required": "GraphQL requires a schema that defines the data types and relationships between each type. The schema provides clients with a description of the data that is available to them.",
	"GraphQL - Schema - Introspection": "GraphQL APIs are self-documenting. Clients can query the API schema to discover the types, queries, mutations, and fields it supports. This introspective capability makes it easier to understand and explore the capabilities of a GraphQL API.",

	"GraphQL - Schema - Types - Enum": "A set of predefined constant values.",
	"GraphQL - Schema - Types - Input": "Used for mutations to pass complex input data.",
	"GraphQL - Schema - Types - Interfaces": "An interface is an abstract type that defines a set of fields that multiple types must implement. Any type that implements an interface must have all the fields declared in that interface.",
	"GraphQL - Schema - Types - Union": "A union is similar to an interface, but unlike interfaces, union types do not require shared fields.",
	"GraphQL - Schema - Fragments": "Reusable query parts to avoid duplication.",
	"GraphQL - Directives": "GraphQL directives are special annotations that modify the behavior of queries, mutations, fields, and schemas at runtime. They provide dynamic control over query execution, validation, and schema transformation.",
	"GraphQL - Directives - Built-in": "",
	"GraphQL - Directives - Custom": "You can create custom directives to extend GraphQL’s functionality.",

	"GraphQL - Client - Requests - Subscriptions": "Used for real-time updates via WebSockets.",
	"GraphQL - Client - Requests - Introspection": "Introspection in GraphQL is a powerful feature that allows clients to query the schema of a GraphQL API to discover its types, fields, queries, mutations, and other details.",

	"GraphQL - Server - Resolvers - Operation - QueryExecution": "Query Execution – When a GraphQL query is executed, each field in the query is processed by a resolver.",
	"GraphQL - Server - Resolvers - Operation - DataFetching": "Data Fetching – The resolver fetches data from a database, API, or another data source.",
	"GraphQL - Server - Resolvers - Operation - ResponseConstruction": "Response Construction – Once all resolvers return data, GraphQL assembles the final response and sends it back to the client.",
	"GraphQL - Server - Resolvers - Format": "A resolver is typically defined as a function with the following signature: const resolverFunction = (parent, args, context, info) => { ... };",
