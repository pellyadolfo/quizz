	"InternetAddressResolutionSPI - Java18": "In Java 18, a new Service Provider Interface (SPI) was introduced for customizable hostname and IP address resolution via JEP 418. This enhancement allows developers to replace the default DNS resolver with their own implementation, enabling better control over how Java applications resolve internet addresses.",

	"DatagramSocketAPI ": "The DatagramSocket API is part of Java's original (pre-NIO) networking package (java.net) and provides a connectionless, unreliable mechanism for sending and receiving UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets. Unlike TCP, UDP does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection, making it suitable for low-latency applications like video streaming, gaming, and DNS lookups.",
