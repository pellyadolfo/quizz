RunImageOnDev - Docker Personal - 2021": "As announced on 31 August 2021, Docker Desktop will turn into Docker Personal and it will be only available freely for small businesses, personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects. For other use case, a paid subscription is required. It will be an issue, since most developer will install Docker Desktop themselves and used in the commercial environment. A free distribution of Docker installation is required for such environment as a new default.",

Or “global”, which ensures that each machine gets exactly one instance of the specified container. You instruct the swarm manager to use these strategies in the Compose file, just like the one you have already been using. Swarm managers are the only machines in a swarm that can execute your commands, or authorize other machines to join the swarm as workers. Workers are just there to provide capacity and do not have the authority to tell any other machine what it can and cannot do. Up until now, you have been using Docker in a single-host mode on your local machine. But Docker also can be switched into swarm mode, and that’s what enables the use of swarms. Enabling swarm mode instantly makes the current machine a swarm manager. From then on, Docker runs the commands you execute on the swarm you’re managing, rather than just on the current machine.",

	"8. ManageCO - Docker - Services": "Services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, which all work together as a swarm with multiple managers and workers. Each member of a swarm is a Docker daemon, and the daemons all communicate using the Docker API. A service allows you to define the desired state, such as the number of replicas of the service that must be available at any given time. By default, the service is load-balanced across all worker nodes. To the consumer, the Docker service appears to be a single application.
