Nest.js often borrows ideas from Java’s Spring framework — Singletons, Dependency Injection, and so forth. In TypeScript/JavaScript, many of these patterns can be implemented in simpler ways, like exporting instances directly from modules. Nest.js adds multiple layers of “magic” that sometimes feel more burdensome than helpful in a dynamic language.",

It’s common for one minor library update to break compatibility with another. I faced scenarios where Nest.js would stop building after a minor version change in a secondary dependency — only because TypeScript definitions had shifted. Rolling back versions or hunting down workarounds took time and energy I’d rather spend on new features.",

	"Processing - Serverless": "Use a deployment infrastructure that hides any concept of servers (i.e. reserved or preallocated resources)- physical or virtual hosts, or containers. The infrastructure takes your service’s code and runs it. You are charged for each request based on the resources consumed. To deploy your service using this approach, you package the code (e.g. as a ZIP file), upload it to the deployment infrastructure and describe the desired performance characteristics. The deployment infrastructure is a utility operated by a public cloud provider. It typically uses either containers or virtual machines to isolate the services. However, these details are hidden from you. Neither you nor anyone else in your organization is responsible for managing any low-level infrastructure such as operating systems, virtual machines, etc.",
