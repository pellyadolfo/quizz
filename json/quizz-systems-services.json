	"Services - Design": "",
	"Services - Design - APIFirst": "The API-first approach, also known as 'design-first' emphasizes the design and documentation of the API as the primary starting point for development. In this approach, the API contract is defined upfront, specifying the resources, endpoints, data structures, and communication protocols before writing any code.",
	"Services - Design - APIFirst - DefineAPIContract": "Create a detailed specification of the API using tools like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), API Blueprint, or RAML. This specification serves as a contract between the API provider and consumers, ensuring a clear understanding of the API’s functionality and behavior.",
	"Services - Design - APIFirst - RefineAPIContract": "Collaborate with stakeholders, including product owners, developers, and potential consumers, to review and refine the API contract until it meets the required functionality and adheres to best practices.",
	"Services - Design - APIFirst - GenerateClientLibraries": "Use the API specification to automatically generate client libraries, documentation, and other artifacts that facilitate API consumption and integration.",
	"Services - Design - APIFirst - ImplementAPI:": "With the contract in place, developers can begin implementing the API logic, adhering strictly to the defined contract.",
	"Services - Design - CodeFirst:": "In contrast to the API-first approach, the code-first approach, also known as 'implementation-first' focuses on writing the application code first and then generating the API contract from the implemented code. This approach is often preferred when the application logic is well-understood, and the API is primarily an interface for exposing the existing functionality.",
	"Services - Design - CodeFirst - DevelopApplicationLogic:": "Write the application code, including business logic, data models, and other components, without initially considering the API.",
	"Services - Design - CodeFirst - DefineAPIContract:": "Use code annotations, decorators, or other language-specific mechanisms to define the API contract based on the existing code.",
	"Services - Design - CodeFirst - GenerateAPISpecification:": "Tools like Swagger, NSwag, or Swashbuckle analyze the code and generate the API specification (e.g., OpenAPI, Swagger JSON/YAML) based on the defined contract.",
	"Services - Design - CodeFirst - IterateAndRefine:": "Review and refine the generated API specification to ensure it aligns with best practices and meets the desired functionality.",

	"Processing - Servers - JS - NestJS - Features - Layers": "Too Many Layers and Abstractions. Nest.js often borrows ideas from Java’s Spring framework — Singletons, Dependency Injection, and so forth. In TypeScript/JavaScript, many of these patterns can be implemented in simpler ways, like exporting instances directly from modules. Nest.js adds multiple layers of “magic” that sometimes feel more burdensome than helpful in a dynamic language.",
	"Processing - Servers - JS - NestJS - Features - Debugging": "Debugging Nightmares. While developing APIs, I encountered stack traces pointing to deeply wrapped compiled JavaScript files. Tracing an error back to the original TypeScript code could become tedious. It slowed me down, especially when quick fixes were needed.",
	"Processing - Servers - JS - NestJS - Features - Dependency": "Version Conflicts and Dependency Chaos. The Node.js ecosystem moves fast. It’s common for one minor library update to break compatibility with another. I faced scenarios where Nest.js would stop building after a minor version change in a secondary dependency — only because TypeScript definitions had shifted. Rolling back versions or hunting down workarounds took time and energy I’d rather spend on new features.",

	"Processing - Servers - JS - Fastify - Features - Dependency": "Reduced Dependency Headaches. Fewer layers mean less risk of version conflicts. Fastify itself is lightweight, and updates generally go smoothly..",

	"Processing - Serverless": "Use a deployment infrastructure that hides any concept of servers (i.e. reserved or preallocated resources)- physical or virtual hosts, or containers. The infrastructure takes your service’s code and runs it. You are charged for each request based on the resources consumed. To deploy your service using this approach, you package the code (e.g. as a ZIP file), upload it to the deployment infrastructure and describe the desired performance characteristics. The deployment infrastructure is a utility operated by a public cloud provider. It typically uses either containers or virtual machines to isolate the services. However, these details are hidden from you. Neither you nor anyone else in your organization is responsible for managing any low-level infrastructure such as operating systems, virtual machines, etc.",
