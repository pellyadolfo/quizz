	"Techniques - UUID": "A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify objects or records in computer systems. There are multiple versions of UUIDs.",
	"Techniques - UUID - unique": "UUIDs are not guaranteed to be unique, instead they are given a certain (typically very low) probability of collision. The probability of generating two UUIDs (especially v4 or v7) that collide is very low, but not zero.",
	"Techniques - UUIDv4": "e942bbe9-afdc-4c62-a438-4efee77954b3 You can tell it’s UUIDv4 because the digit ‘4’ appears in the 13th position. This is a key identifier for the version of the UUID.",
	"Techniques - UUIDv7": "01922e13-43f2-79ef-ab97-ca7a7d021d34 UUIDv7 is a time-based version of UUID, meaning that the identifiers are generated in an increasing order.",
	"Techniques - UUIDv7 - ordered": "Because the UUIDs are time-based, they are ordered, which leads to better indexing performance compared to the randomness of UUIDv4.",
	"Techniques - ULID": "Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier. ULID is a UUID alternative that is also globally unique, but with the added benefit of being lexicographically sortable."
