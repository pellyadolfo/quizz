Example: If the bucket size is 10 and the rate is 1 request per second, and a burst of 20 requests comes in, the first 10 are queued and processed at 1 per second, while the rest are either queued (if the bucket can hold them) or discarded.",

	"Invokation - DDoS - Throttling - Algorithms - SlidingWindow": "The sliding window is an improved version of the fixed window, addressing the issue where the fixed window receives twice the threshold number of requests when the window is switched. In the sliding window algorithm, the start and end times of the window are dynamic, while the window size remains fixed. This algorithm effectively handles the window boundary problem, but its implementation is relatively complex due to the need to record the timestamp of each request.",
